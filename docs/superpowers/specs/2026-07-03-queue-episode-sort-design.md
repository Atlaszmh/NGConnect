# Queue Episode-Order Sort — Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Status:** Approved
**Author:** Zach + Claude

## Problem

When a show is grabbed as individual episodes (e.g. season monitoring searches
and grabs several single-episode releases), SABnzbd downloads them in whatever
order they landed in the queue — not episode order. Since SAB downloads
top-to-bottom, the result is that you can't reliably start watching E01 while the
rest finish. The user wants a show's episodes to download in chronological
(season → episode) order, unattended.

## Goals

- Keep the SABnzbd queue ordered so each show's **episodes download in
  season→episode order**, continuously and **headless** (no browser needed).
- Group a show's episodes together (relative to other shows) while **leaving
  non-episode items — movies, season packs, unparseable names — exactly where
  they are** in the queue (no starvation of movies behind a TV backlog).
- Expose an **on/off toggle** on the Downloads page (default ON), so the user can
  disable it to hand-arrange the queue by dragging.

## Non-Goals

- Sorting across download clients other than SABnzbd, or anything on the History
  tab.
- Per-episode *download-priority* tuning beyond queue position.
- Cross-referencing Sonarr/Radarr for episode metadata (we parse the SAB
  filename — see Approach). Daily-dated and absolute-numbered (anime) releases
  that lack `SxxEyy` are intentionally treated as non-episodes.
- Persisting the toggle across server restarts (in-memory, default ON — mirrors
  the existing VPN kill-switch config; a restart re-enables it, which is the
  intended default).
- Changing how grabs enter the queue, or the existing drag-to-reorder mechanism
  itself (only disabled in the UI while the toggle is ON).

## Context (current state)

- **Downloads page** (`client/src/pages/DownloadsPage.tsx`) fetches the queue
  directly from SABnzbd via `GET /sabnzbd/api?mode=queue`; each slot carries
  `nzo_id`, `filename`, `cat`, `percentage`, etc. — **no structured
  season/episode**.
- **Reorder primitive already works:** the page has drag-to-reorder (`@dnd-kit`)
  that persists a move with `GET /sabnzbd/api?mode=switch&value=<nzo_id>&value2=<index>`.
  `value2` is the target position; the existing code trusts SAB to insert-at that
  index and shift the rest.
- **Background-monitor pattern exists:** `server/src/services/vpnMonitor.ts` is a
  module with an in-memory config (`{ enabled, pollIntervalMs, … }`),
  `getKillSwitchConfig()/updateKillSwitchConfig(partial)`, a `setInterval` poll
  loop with `try/catch`, `start…/stop…` functions, and a **pure, unit-tested**
  parse helper (`parseVpnStatus`). Started from `index.ts`.
- **Toggle-config route pattern exists:** `server/src/routes/system.ts` exposes
  `GET /vpn/killswitch` and `PUT /vpn/killswitch` over that in-memory config.
- **SAB proxy** (`server/src/routes/sabnzbd.ts`) forwards arbitrary query params
  to `${sabnzbd.url}/api` with the key server-side.
- Sonarr/Radarr/SAB are **localhost-only on the server PC** → any live queue test
  is user-run on the server PC (dev PC can build + run unit tests only).

## Approach: filename parsing (chosen)

Parse season/episode from the SAB `filename` with a regex, rather than
cross-referencing Sonarr's queue. The filename is already in the payload we
fetch; every SAB item now originates from a Sonarr/Radarr grab, so names are
standardized `Show.Name.SxxEyy…`. This keeps the feature self-contained, adds no
arr coupling, and makes the core logic a set of **pure functions** (the
codebase's established, unit-tested style). Items that don't match `SxxEyy` are
treated as non-episodes and left in place.

## Architecture Overview

A server-side background loop (mirroring `vpnMonitor`) keeps the SAB queue sorted;
a small toggle config controls it; the Downloads page renders a switch. Three
**pure functions** hold all the real logic and are unit-tested; the loop and the
SAB HTTP calls are thin I/O around them.

## Component 1: `server/src/services/queueSort.ts`

### Pure functions (unit-tested)

**`parseEpisode(filename: string): { show: string; season: number; episode: number } | null`**
- Regex on `SxxEyy`, case-insensitive, tolerating `.`/`_`/space separators, e.g.
  `/^(?<show>.*?)[._ -]+s(?<s>\d{1,2})e(?<e>\d{1,3})/i`.
- `show` = the prefix before `SxxEyy`, normalized (replace `._` with spaces,
  collapse whitespace, trim, lowercase) — used only as a grouping key.
- Multi-episode names (`S01E01E02`, `S01E01-E02`) → use the **first** episode.
- No match (movies, season packs like `S01` with no `E`, daily `2024.01.15`,
  absolute-numbered anime) → `null`.

**`episodeSortOrder(slots: { nzo_id: string; filename: string }[]): string[]`**
Produces the **desired** `nzo_id` order under the "non-episodes hold their
position" rule:
1. Classify each slot via `parseEpisode`: *episode* or *non-episode*.
2. **Non-episode items are fixed points:** `desired[currentIndex] = item`.
3. The remaining indices (ascending) are the *episode slots*.
4. Sort the episode items by: **show-group order**, then season, then episode.
   Show-group order = ascending by the **minimum current index** among that
   show's episodes (so the show whose topmost episode sits highest comes first;
   deterministic and stable).
5. Fill the episode slots (in ascending index order) with the sorted episode
   list. Return the length-N `nzo_id` array.

This gathers+orders each show's episodes among themselves while every
non-episode keeps its absolute queue index (a movie at index 2 stays at index 2;
episodes reorder around it).

**`planMoves(currentIds: string[], desiredIds: string[]): { nzo_id: string; position: number }[]`**
- Transforms `current` → `desired` as a minimal sequence of "move item to
  position i" ops (each maps 1:1 to a SAB `switch` call). Walk `i = 0…N-1`; if
  the working array already has `desired[i]` at `i`, skip; else find it later in
  the working array, splice it to `i`, and emit `{ nzo_id: desired[i], position: i }`.
- Returns `[]` when `current` already equals `desired` → **the loop issues zero
  SAB calls when nothing is out of place** (idempotent; no churn once sorted).

### Loop + config (thin I/O, not unit-tested — live)

- In-memory `queueSortConfig = { enabled: true, pollIntervalMs: 15000 }` with
  `getQueueSortConfig()` and `updateQueueSortConfig(partial)` (restart the
  interval if the interval changed) — the kill-switch shape.
- `startQueueSorter()/stopQueueSorter()` — `setInterval(tick, pollIntervalMs)`.
- `tick()`: if `!enabled`, return. Fetch `mode=queue` from SAB (key server-side).
  Build `slots` (`nzo_id`, `filename`), compute `desired = episodeSortOrder(slots)`,
  `moves = planMoves(currentIds, desired)`; for each move call
  `mode=switch&value=<nzo_id>&value2=<position>`. Wrap in `try/catch` → log and
  skip the tick on any error (SAB unreachable, etc.). Reorders even when the
  queue is paused (sets order for when it resumes).

## Component 2: route — `server/src/routes/system.ts`

Mirror the kill-switch endpoints:
- `GET /system/queue-sort` → `getQueueSortConfig()`.
- `PUT /system/queue-sort` → `updateQueueSortConfig(req.body)` then return the
  config. Body: `{ enabled?: boolean; pollIntervalMs?: number }` (validate types;
  ignore unknown keys).

## Component 3: wiring — `server/src/index.ts`

Call `startQueueSorter()` alongside `startVpnMonitor()` at startup.

## Component 4: client — `client/src/pages/DownloadsPage.tsx`

- On mount, `GET /system/queue-sort` → `enabled` state. Render a **"Keep in
  episode order"** toggle in the Queue tab header; on change, `PUT` the new value
  (optimistic).
- While `enabled`, **disable the drag handles** (the server would undo manual
  drags within one tick). While disabled, drag works exactly as today.
- The page's existing 5 s queue poll already reflects the server-applied order —
  the client does **no** sorting itself; it only renders and toggles.

## Data Flow

SAB grabs episodes out of order → server `tick()` (≤15 s) fetches the queue →
`episodeSortOrder` computes the desired order (episodes gathered/ordered,
non-episodes fixed) → `planMoves` yields switch ops → SAB `switch` calls reorder
the real queue → SAB downloads top-to-bottom in episode order → Downloads page
poll shows the sorted queue. Toggle OFF → `tick()` no-ops and drag re-enables.

## Error Handling

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Toggle OFF | `tick()` returns immediately; no SAB calls; drag re-enabled in UI. |
| SAB unreachable / error | `try/catch` logs and skips the tick; retries next interval. |
| Empty or single-item queue | `planMoves` returns `[]`; no-op. |
| Already sorted | `planMoves` returns `[]`; **zero** switch calls. |
| Paused queue | Still reordered (order applies when resumed). |
| Multi-episode file (`S01E01E02`) | Sorted by the first episode. |
| Unparseable / movie / season pack | Treated as non-episode; index held. |

## Testing Strategy

- **`parseEpisode` (pure):** standard `S01E05`; lowercase `s1e5`; dot vs space vs
  underscore separators; multi-episode `S01E01E02` → episode 1; season pack `S01`
  → null; movie `Movie.Name.2021.1080p` → null; daily `Show.2024.01.15` → null;
  show-name normalization.
- **`episodeSortOrder` (pure):** the multi-show before→after example (ShowB/ShowA
  interleaved → grouped+ordered); non-episode held at its absolute index while
  episodes reorder around it; already-sorted input returns the same order;
  single show out of order → ordered.
- **`planMoves` (pure):** equal arrays → `[]`; one item out of place → one move;
  fully reversed → correct sequence; a move sequence that reproduces `desired`
  when replayed.
- **Client:** `npm run build` (typecheck) is the gate (no client test harness).
- **USER-RUN on the server PC** (SAB is localhost-only): with the toggle ON, get
  a show's episodes into the queue out of order (or drag them out of order) and
  confirm SAB reorders them to E01→E02→… within ~15 s and downloads in that
  order; confirm a movie in the queue **keeps its position**; toggle OFF and
  confirm a manual drag now persists. Verify the two SAB-behavior unknowns:
  reordering the **actively-downloading** item is not disruptive, and **priority
  tiers** don't fight the `switch` positions.

## Risks / Open Questions

- **SAB `switch` position semantics** (insert-at-index vs swap) are assumed from
  the existing drag code; if they differ, the loop still **converges** over
  successive ticks (it recomputes each time). Confirmed by the live check.
- **Priority tiers:** SAB may keep Force/High-priority items in their own tier;
  `switch` within a tier should still order episodes, but cross-tier ordering is
  SAB-controlled — noted for the live check.
- **Filename parsing** can't order daily/absolute-numbered releases; these fall
  back to "non-episode, hold position," which is acceptable per Non-Goals.

## Files Touched

**New:**
- `server/src/services/queueSort.ts` — `parseEpisode`, `episodeSortOrder`,
  `planMoves`, config + loop.
- `server/src/services/queueSort.test.ts` — unit tests for the three pure
  functions.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-queue-episode-sort-design.md` (this file).

**Modified:**
- `server/src/routes/system.ts` — `GET`/`PUT /system/queue-sort`.
- `server/src/index.ts` — start the sorter loop.
- `client/src/pages/DownloadsPage.tsx` — toggle UI + fetch/update; disable drag
  while enabled.
